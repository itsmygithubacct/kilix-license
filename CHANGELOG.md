# Changelog

All notable changes to `kilix-license` are recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Established the local-only repository identity with MIT licensing
  (LIC3 re-confirms the licence file).
- Pinned Python 3.12.8 and uv 0.12.5 for the empty runtime dependency
  closure.
- Added a hermetic harness: fixture records, FakeStore in a temp dir,
  and a guard that refuses the live receipt store.
- Added a tracked-tree weight guard (suffix, magic, catalog-digest list).
- Added the licence-record schema, verbatim screen, agreement capture,
  and digest-bound atomic receipts.
- Added binding-scoped covers() and require(); catalogue-digest binding
  is refused.
