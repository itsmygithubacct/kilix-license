    ``captured_at_a_terminal`` is off by default and changes nothing when it
    is: coverage is the OD-AI binding and nothing else, so every receipt any
    earlier kilix-license wrote is accepted exactly as before.

    Switched on, it additionally demands that the receipt record a capture at
    a terminal (V-ACC-VERIFY F6's ``acceptance.capture_mode``). That refuses a
    receipt written with no console -- a build step, an image, a provisioning
    script -- and refuses every receipt written before LIC6, which record no
    capture at all. It is not proof a person accepted anything, and it says
    nothing about which person: see
    :class:`kilix_license.agreement.Acceptance` for exactly what a receipt
    proves and does not. It is the weakest mechanical check that distinguishes
    a receipt minted at a console from one that was shipped.

    OD-BC keeps this lever **available and off**, and pairs it with a rule
    that no flag can enforce: a receipt is never shipped, vendored or
    provisioned, and shipping one is not an acceptable remedy for a refusing
    gate. The acceptable outcomes are acceptance at first use, or no weights.
    See ``README.md``.
